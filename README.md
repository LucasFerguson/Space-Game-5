  * Hold down **G, H,** and **J** to fire different weapons.
* **Challenges:**
  * Survive for as long as you can as the difficulty increases!
  * Fast-paced gameplay
  * Low-friction environment
* **Details:**
  * 8-bit-inspired sound effects.
  * Build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  * Used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/about/) rendering library

## **Development Journey**

**Star Shooter V5** is the result of steady improvement over four years of game development. Starting with my first space game, Iâ€™ve added new features and gameplay mechanics to each version, building on my previous work.

I hope you enjoy playing it as much as Iâ€™ve enjoyed creating it!
